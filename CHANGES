HEAD -- Version X.X.X

Version 3.0.1
(18 Nov, 2011)
  Improvements:
   * Verification infrastructure:
     - support masks in nf_test_expect
     - terminate tests if a thread fails to start

  Bug fixes:
   * Fix kernel compilation in 2.6.37+ (init_MUTEX removed)

Version 3.0.0 (official)
(01 Sept, 2011)
  Improvements:
   * See 3.0.0_pre1

  Removed:
   * Legacy tests from
     - reference_nic
     - reference_router
     - reference_switch
     - router_buffer_sizing
     - scone
     - router_kit

  Bug fixes:

   * Modified router_buffer_sizing test hw_time_stamp to pass
      (needs to be rewritten)

Version 3.0.0_pre1 (pre-release 1)
(12 Aug, 2011)
  Improvements:
   * Verification infrastructure -- rewritten, Python-based
     - unified: run same tests in simulation and on hardware
     - reduces the need to specify explicit delays in test code
     - barriers: enables tests to be partitioned into sections in which code
                 preceding a barrier must complete before proceeding past
		 barrier

		 Use case: 1) send and expect a number of packets,
		           2) read registers only after *all* packets have
			      been received

     - pcap: standard-format pcap files are generated for all tests run
             in hardware
     - random seed: can specify the random seed to use when running tests,
                    allowing random data to be reproduced identically across runs
     - legacy mode: run existing tests without rewriting
   * project XML:
     - remove unused "strip_headers" module from all projects

  Bug fixes:
   * register system:
     - fix width calculation bug in compound types

     - tests updated to reflect library location updates
   * Wireshark:
     Include plugins for:
       - PWOSPF

     Note: These currently do *not* compile without work from the user
   * driver:
     - add support for /sys/class/net under Linux 2.6+
   * fetch_mem_models:
     - included a script for fetching the memory models for simulation
   * build system:
     - UCF files provided by modules will be merged

   * reg_proxy_client:
     - updated to use new register names
   * download:
     - don't report -1 when downloading against the current CPCI
     - include a warning when an unknown CPCI is used
   * cpci_reprogram:
     - handle blank lines cleanly in lspci output
   * SCONE:
     - fix regression tests when run under Python > 2.4 (return value of hex()
       of an unexpected type)
   * Ethernet queue:
     - Correct crossed connection between CRC gen and CRC check signals
   * build system:
     - ensure the CPCI builds on a clean checkout

   * Java GUI automatically built if Java compiler exists on system
   * simulation:
     - don't list tests run in GUI mode as passing
     - restrict GUI mode to a single test at a time

  Bug fixes:
   * cpci_reprogram.pl checks for root before reprogramming
   * fix build issue if make install is run from top-level directory

     (reported by Jonathan Ellithorpe <jdellit at stanford.edu>)
   * Fix core dependency identification to prevent occassional problems

      the forums)

  Bug fixes:
    * Some register writes were missed when doing back-to-back writes
      (a buffer full signal was asserted too late)
